`cl2j.DataStore` is a multi-providers CRUD repoository abstraction library written in C#. It's an open and extensible framework based on interfaces and Dependency Injection.

Providers supported:

- `JSON` - Data store that use a JSON file for CRUD

The library also support a memory cache DataStore implemented as a [Decorator Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern). See below for more information.

# Getting started

The setup is simple.

1. Add the nuget package to your project:

```powershell
Install-Package cl2j.DataStore.Json
```

2. Add the following lines in the appsettings.json to configure the IFileStoreProvider:

```json
"cl2j": {
    "FileStorage": {
        "Storages": {
            "DataStore": {
                "Type": "Disk",
                "Path": "<ThePathOfTheJSONFiles>"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The settings configure a Disk FileStorage provider, which use `System.IO` classes.
Path is the local path, i.e. c:\dev, where the json file will be.

> cl2j.DataStore use [cl2j.FileStorage](https://github.com/jfblier/cl2j.FileStorage) library to abstract the access to the file system. This allow to use different providers like Disk, Azure, AWS, etc.

3. Configures the services by calling `AddFileStorage()` and then `AddDataStoreListJson()` or `AddDataStoreDictionaryJson()`.

4. Get the `IDataStoreList` or `IDataStoreDictionary` configured and perform CRUD operatons.

`AddDataStoreListJson` receive three parameters:

1. The name of the FileStore to use. That's the name declared in the appsettings.json.
2. The name of the file were the data are persisted.
3. A function that return the unique key to identify the item.

## Web Application

```cs
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
  ...

  //Bootstrap the FileStorage to be available from DependencyInjection.
  //This will allow accessing IFileStorageProviderFactory instance
  services.AddFileStorage();

  //Configure the JSON DataStore.
  //The store will use the FileStorageProvider to access the file colors.json.
  //The field Id represent the key for the Color class
  services.AddDataStoreListJson<string, Color>("DataStore", "colors.json", (color) => color.Id);
}

public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
  ...

  //Add the Disk FileStorage provider
  app.ApplicationServices.UseFileStorageDisk();
}
```

## Console Application

```cs
var services = new ServiceCollection();
...

//Bootstrap the FileStorage to be available from DependencyInjection.
//This will allow accessing IFileStorageProviderFactory instance
services.AddFileStorage();

//Configure the JSON DataStore.
//The store will use the FileStorageProvider to access the file colors.json.
//The field Id represent the key for the Color class
services.AddDataStoreListJson<string, Color>("DataStore", "colors.json", (color) => color.Id);

//Add the Disk FileStorage provider
var serviceProvider = services.BuildServiceProvider();
serviceProvider.UseFileStorageDisk();
```

# Sample code

Here's a class that execute common operations.

```cs
internal class DataStoreSample
{
    private readonly IDataStoreList<string, Color> dataStoreColorRead;

    public DataStoreSample(IDataStoreList<string, Color> dataStoreColorRead)
    {
        this.dataStoreColorRead = dataStoreColorRead;
    }

    public async Task ExecuteAsync()
    {
        //Create colors
        await dataStoreColorRead.InsertAsync(new Color { Id = "red", Value = "#f00" });
        await dataStoreColorRead.InsertAsync(new Color { Id = "green", Value = "#0f0" });
        await dataStoreColorRead.InsertAsync(new Color { Id = "blue", Value = "#00f" });
        await dataStoreColorRead.InsertAsync(new Color { Id = "cyan", Value = "#0ff" });
        await dataStoreColorRead.InsertAsync(new Color { Id = "magenta", Value = "#f0f" });
        await dataStoreColorRead.InsertAsync(new Color { Id = "yellow", Value = "#ff0" });
        await dataStoreColorRead.InsertAsync(new Color { Id = "black", Value = "#000" });

        //Retreive all the colors
        var colors = await dataStoreColorRead.GetAllAsync();
        foreach (var color in colors)
            Debug.WriteLine($"{color.Id} -> {color.Value}");

        //Retreive the color black and update it's value
        var black = await dataStoreColorRead.GetByIdAsync("black");
        if (black != null)
        {
            black.Value = "#111";
            await dataStoreColorRead.UpdateAsync(black.Id, black);
        }

        //Delete a color
        await dataStoreColorRead.DeleteAsync("magenta");
    }
}
```

The class receive, by Dependency Injection, the `IDataStoreList`. The ExecuteAsync method insert colors, retreive all the colors inserted, modify the black color value and remove the magenta color.

A file named `colors.json` was created:

```json
[
  {
    "Id": "red",
    "Value": "#f00"
  },
  {
    "Id": "green",
    "Value": "#0f0"
  },
  {
    "Id": "blue",
    "Value": "#00f"
  },
  {
    "Id": "cyan",
    "Value": "#0ff"
  },
  {
    "Id": "yellow",
    "Value": "#ff0"
  },
  {
    "Id": "black",
    "Value": "#111"
  }
]
```

# Operations

Here's the operations available from the `IDataStoreList` interface:

```cs
public interface IDataStoreList<TKey, TValue>
{
    //Retreive all the items
    Task<IEnumerable<TValue>> GetAllAsync();

    //Get an item by it's key (Id)
    Task<TValue> GetByIdAsync(TKey key);

    //Insert a new item. The key must not exists
    Task InsertAsync(TValue entity);

    //Update an item
    Task UpdateAsync(TValue entity);

    //Delete an item
    Task DeleteAsync(TKey key);
}
```

Here's the operations available from the `IDataStoreDictionary` interface:

```cs
public interface IDataStoreDictionary<TKey, TValue>
{
    //Retreive all the items
    Task<Dictionary<TKey, TValue>> GetAllAsync();

    //Get an item by it's key (Id)
    Task<TValue> GetByIdAsync(TKey key);

    //Insert a new item. The key must not exists
    Task InsertAsync(TValue entity);

    //Update an item
    Task UpdateAsync(TValue entity);

    //Delete an item
    Task DeleteAsync(TKey key);
}
```

# Cache

Adding a memory cache, that is thread-safe, and refresh itself at specified interval is as simple as adding the following line in your startup or program:

```cs
services.AddDataStoreListJsonWithCache<string, Color>("Color", "DataStore", "colors.json", (color) => color.Id, TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5));
```

As the DataStoreCache is a `Decorator Pattern` and implement the `IDataStoreList` interface, using the cache is the same as using the `IDataStoreList`.

- `Cache name` Name of the cache - for logging purpose
- `FileStore name` Name of the FileStore to use. That's the name declared in the appsettings.json.
- `File name` Name of the file were the data are persisted.
- `Key identifier` A lambda expression that return the unique key of the item. In the example, It's the Id property of the Color class.
- `Refresh interval` A TimeSpan indicating the interval that the cache will be refreshed. In the example, we indicate that the cache will be refreshed every 5 seconds.

# Roadmap

- Add new implementation
  - `Database` implementation using reflection to create, modify and delete objects
- `CQRS` Use CQRS pattern to decouple the read and write. This will allow
- `Cache` Add a simple builtin caching mecanism to have performant read DataStore
- Helper to convert to Dictionary DataStore
